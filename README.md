# haunted-house-threejs

## Project Overview

Brought a haunted house to life using Three.js primitives as geometries and textures. 

## Project Features

Basic Geometries- Used Three.js primitive geometries to build the main structure of the haunted house, including walls, a roof, and a door.

Texture- To add depth and realism to the project, I utilized textures located in the /static/textures/ folder. These textures gave the haunted house and surroundings a distinctly spooky appearance.

Spooky Ambiance- Introduced multicolored lights that float around and pass through objects to create a supernatural atmosphere that adds to the haunted feel of the scene.
